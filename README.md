A roguelike.

This is based on the [tutorial for Python3 + tcod](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/) . The main difference right now is that I'm not using the deprecated functions that the tutorial uses. Right now, this means that I'm handling events, console, and fov objects differently.
