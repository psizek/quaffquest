# QuaffQuest

A roguelike.

This is based on the [tutorial for Python3 + tcod](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/) . The main difference right now is that I'm not using the deprecated functions from tcod that the tutorial uses. Right now, this means that I'm handling events, console, and fov objects differently, among other things.

This is a work in progress, so things will get less simplistic/playable as time goes on, and eventually I'll get a commit in which I no longer need this disclaimer.

# Requirements
python 3.7+, and tcod - instructions for tcod install can be found [here](https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
