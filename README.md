# QuaffQuest

A roguelike.

This was originally based on the [tutorial for Python3 + tcod](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/), but I've diverged not insubstantially from the code at this point.

This is a work in progress, so things will get less simplistic/playable as time goes on, and eventually I'll get a commit in which I no longer need this disclaimer. Although this might just be me tweaking the engine until I get something that I like and is also easy to use for a seperate project...
