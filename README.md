# QuaffQuest

A roguelike.

This is based on the [tutorial for Python3 + tcod](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/), diverging where I think improvements could be made. A large difference is that I didn't use the deprecated functions from tcod that the tutorial uses, which means that I handle events, console, and fov objects differently, among other things.

This is a work in progress, so things will get less simplistic/playable as time goes on, and eventually I'll get a commit in which I no longer need this disclaimer.

# Requirements
python 3.7+, and tcod - instructions for tcod install can be found [here](https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
